## Pyber Analysis:

    1). Urban city types have the lowest average fare price considering they also have the highest driver count and number of rides.

    2). The Suburban city types represent the median average fare price, driver count and number of rides.

    3). The Rural city types have the highest average fare price due to having the lowest driver count and total number of rides.

    In conclusion, the average fare price is dependent upon the city types total driver and ride counts. City types with more drivers/ride counts appear to have lower average fare prices and city types with less drivers/overall rides produce higher fare values.
